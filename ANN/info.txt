🔹 What is a Perceptron?

A Perceptron is the basic building block of neural networks and deep learning.
It is a single artificial neuron that takes inputs, applies weights, adds a bias, and produces an output using an activation function.

👉 Think of it as the simplest form of a neural network.



	​

🔹 Activation Function (Step Function)

The classic perceptron uses a binary step function:

Output = 1 → Positive class

Output = 0 → Negative class

This makes the perceptron suitable for binary classification.

🔹 Working of Perceptron (Step-by-Step)

Take input values

Multiply inputs with weights

Add bias

Apply activation function

Generate output







▶️ Forward Propagation (Prediction)

Input → weights → bias → activation

Computes output / prediction

Moves input → output

No learning happens here




◀️ Backward Propagation (Learning)

Computes gradients of loss

Uses chain rule

Moves output → input

Updates weights & bias

🧠 Key Differences
Forward	Backward
Prediction	Learning
Input → Output	Output → Input
Uses weights	Updates weights




One-Line Summary (Exam Ready)

Forward propagation predicts output, backward propagation minimizes error by updating weights using gradients.





🔹 What is Gradient Descent?

Optimization algorithm used to minimize loss function

Updates model parameters (weights & bias)

Core learning method in Deep Learning

🔹 Key Idea

Move parameters in the opposite direction of gradient

Gradient = slope of loss function

🔹 Types (IMP)
Type	Description
Batch GD	Uses full dataset
Stochastic GD (SGD)	Uses one sample
Mini-batch GD	Uses small batch (most used)
🔹 Learning Rate (η)

Too small → slow learning

Too large → divergence

Proper value → fast convergence

🔹 Role in Neural Networks

Uses gradients from backpropagation

Updates weights after each iteration/epoch

⭐ One-Line Summary (Exam Ready)

Gradient Descent minimizes loss by updating parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient.
